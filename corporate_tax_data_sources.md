### Calculating Effective Corporate Tax Rate

**Formula**: Effective Tax Rate = (Corporate Tax Receipts / Corporate Profits Before Tax) Ã— 100

**Using FRED Data**:
- Quarterly: Use B075RC1Q027SBEA / A053RC1Q027SBEA
- Annual: Use FCTAX / (Annual sum of A053RC1Q027SBEA)

## Other Official Data Sources

### Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
- **Historical Effective Tax Rates**: https://www.cbo.gov/topics/taxes/tax-rates
- **Corporate Tax Analysis**: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59149
- Provides analysis of effective tax rates from 1979 onwards
- Includes international comparisons and policy analysis

### Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
- **National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)**: https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/corporate-profits
- Source for corporate profits data used in FRED
- Provides detailed breakdowns of corporate income and taxes

### Tax Policy Center
- **Corporate Tax Statistics**: https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics

- Policy analysis and revenue estimates

## Key Considerations

1. **IVA and CCAdj**: 
   - IVA = Inventory Valuation Adjustment
   - CCAdj = Capital Consumption Adjustment
   - Series without these adjustments provide cleaner comparisons for tax rate calculations

2. **Historical Data Availability**:
   - Annual data: Available from 1929 (FCTAX series)
   - Quarterly data: Available from 1947 (most series)
   - Most comprehensive data: Post-1950

3. **Effective vs. Statutory Rates**:
   - Effective rates show actual taxes paid relative to profits
   - Statutory rates are the legal tax rates set by law
   - Gap between them reflects deductions, credits, and tax planning

4. **Recent Changes**:
   - 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced corporate rate from 35% to 21%
   - Important to note structural breaks in the data around major tax reforms
